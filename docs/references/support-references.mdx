## Custom Domain

The following provides information on how to use a custom domain for livestreaming with Livepeer Studio:

- Livepeer Studio Ingest URL
- Name your URL
- Configure your URL

- Livepeer Ingest URL

The Livepeer Studio.com global-optimized ingest URL is
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live/{stream-key}`.

- Naming your URL
- You can CNAME `rtmp.livepeer.studio` to customize that URL to something with your
brand, e.g. `rtmp.companyname.io`. 

- Configuring your URL

- You can configure this with your DNS
provider.


## Stream delivery via CDN

Playback for all Pro plan streams is delivered via a content delivery network
(CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded
renditions based on the viewers’ available bandwidth, device performance, and
network conditions.

Non-CDN delivery for free tier users is limited to 10 viewers per account.

## What if playback isn’t working?

Look at the `lastSeen` and `isActive` (Status row on the Livepeer Studio Dashboard)
values. If ingest was properly configured for playback, `lastSeen` will show the
current date and time and `isActive` will be `true` (Status row on the
Livepeer Studio Dashboard will be Active).

If this isn't the case, confirm the `streamKey` and RTMP ingest URL,
`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.studio/live`, are configured correctly in your broadcast
software.

Lastly, check that your playback URL is correct.
