# Create a Livestream

Get started creating RTMP streams of your own using the Livepeer Studio Dashboard or API.

<!--tabs-->

# Dashboard

[Livepeer Studio Dashboard](https://docs.livepeer.studio/core-concepts/tech-overview#how-does-livepeer-studio-work) is a no-code solution that provides all of the infrastructure tools you need to create streams on a user-friendly interface.

## Setup

Before getting started, you must set up your environment for creating your stream:

1. Sign up for a [free Livepeer Studio account](https://livepeer.studio/login).
2. Download and install the broadcasting software of your preference that supports the RTMP protocol. We strongly recommend using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). 

> Livepeer Studio services can run on any operating system, and you can use any development environment that supports your IDE library (VS Code, Sublime, etc.).

## Step by step 

1. Log in to the [Livepeer Studio Dashboard](https://livepeer.studio/).
2. Access the `Streams` section in the side menu:

3. Tap `Create stream`.
4. Give your stream a name:

> Remember to pick a unique name with URL-compatible characters only.

5. Copy the stream's `Playback URL` and `Stream Key` data in its Details description.  
6. Paste them into your broadcasting software according to the required fields to create the stream. 
7. Tap `Go Live` in your broadcasting software to start streaming. 

> Notice that you can also manage configuration and usage information of a stream in the [Stream section](livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams).

# API

The Livepeer Studio API provides a public endpoint to create optimal streams directly from your machine. 

## Setup

Before getting started, you must set up your environment for creating your stream with the Livepeer Studio API:

1. [Get an API key](https://docs.livepeer.studio/guides/livestreaming/api-key#get-an-api-key-using-the-livepeer-studio-dashboard).
2. Install the broadcasting software of your preference that supports the RTMP protocol. We strongly recommend using [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). 
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/).

> Livepeer Studio services can run on any operating system, and you can use any development environment that supports your IDE library (VS Code, Sublime, etc.).

## Step by step 

1. Create a `POST` request to the LivePeer Studio API (`https://livepeer.studio/api/stream`) using the following example code:

<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "480p",
      "bitrate": 1000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 854,
      "height": 480
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
```
</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

> All API requests must be made over HTTPS. API requests without proper authentication will fail.

2. Update the  `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme using the API Key previously fetched as the value.
3. Update the `name` parameter to give your stream a name. 

> Remember to pick a unique name with URL-compatible characters only.

4. Update the `profile` parameter with the desired values for your stream. 

> Caution: If you do not define transcoding rendering with the `profiles` parameter, no transcoding will happen. Your playback video will have the attributes of the source stream only, and it will not take advantage of adaptive bitrate streaming, likely buffering.

5. Make the `POST` request to create your stream. If successful, the `POST` should return a response similar to the following example:


<CodeBlockTabs>
<CodeBlockTabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
 
```js
{  
"name":"test_stream",  
"profiles":[  
{"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},  
{"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480}],  
{"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360}],  
"id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",  
"createdAt":1596081229373,  
"streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",  
"playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",  
{...}  
}
```
 
</CodeBlockTabItem>
</CodeBlockTabs>

6. Copy the parameters' `playbackId`, `streamKey` and `id` values.  
7. Paste them into your broadcasting software according to the required fields to create the stream. 
8. Tap `Go Live` in your broadcasting software to start streaming.

## Best practices

When creating your Livestream, take into consideration the main criteria for a sucessful video rendering, such as:

-   Proper formats of video files.
-   Reliable internet connection.
-   Proper video setting in broadcasting software for streaming.
-   File sizes.
-   Video players.
