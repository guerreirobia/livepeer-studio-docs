title: Verify Active Streams
---

This guide provides steps and information about verifying streams:

- Ways to verify if the stream `isActive`

## What You Need To Know

- Familiarity with Livepeer Studio core concepts
- Experience working with APIs

## What You Can Build Here


- Understanding if a stream is active or idle



## Technical Preparation

Before getting started, you can set up your environment to prepare for developing your application:

- Sign up for a free Livepeer account
- Get an API key
- Access the [API Reference](/../references/stream)

## Ways to Verify Livestream

There are two ways to verify a livestream:

- Via the API
- Via the dashboard(no code)



## Verify stream status with the API

Make a `GET` request to `https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}`, and note the
value of `isActive` in the response. `true` means the `stream` is active, and
Livepeer Studio is ingesting video with that stream’s `streamKey`. `false` means
that Livepeer Studio is not ingesting any video with that `streamKey`.

`lastSeen` represents when the stream was last observed by the monitoring
system. The time is reported in Unix epoch time. If the stream is running, the
epoch will be close to the current time.

### Request

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.studio/api/stream/{id}"
```

### Response

This is an example response:

```json
{
    "name":"test_stream",
    "profiles":[
        {"name":"720p","bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"width":1280,"height":720},
        {"name":"480p","bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"width":854,"height":480}],
        {"name":"360p","bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"width":640,"height":360}],
    "id":"ijkl61f3-95bd-4971-a7b1-4dcb5d39e78a",
    "createdAt":1596081229373,
    "streamKey":"abcd-uimq-jtgy-x98v",
    "playbackId":"efghb2mxupongp5k",
    "isActive":"true",
    "lastSeen":1596119750455",
    {other asset object keys}
}
```

## Return All Active Livestreams

This example shows a decoded JSON object.
 > **NOTE:** Anything passed as
a parameter in a `GET` request URL must be URL encoded.

### Request

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.studio/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": true}]"
```

### Response 

If there are active streams, `isActive: true` will be listed in the response along with a list of the streams. If no active streams are present, the response returns an empty array `[]`.

## Return All Idle Livestreams

This example shows a decoded JSON object. Remember that anything passed as a
parameter in a `GET` request URL must be URL encoded.

### Request

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.studio/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": false}]"
```

### Response 

If there are idle streams, `isActive: false` will be listed in the response along with a list of only idle streams.

## Verify stream status with the Dashboard

The easiest way to confirm a live stream is active is to login to the
Livepeer Studio Dashboard, navigate to the
[Streams page](https://livepeer.studio/dashboard/streams), and
click on a stream name. Look at the Status row to see if the stream is Active or
Idle. If the status Idle, that means that Livepeer Studio is not ingesting any
video with that stream’s `streamKey`.
