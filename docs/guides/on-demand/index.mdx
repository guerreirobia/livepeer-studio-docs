On Demand supports several methods to import and manage videos.

## About On Demand

When a video (`asset`) is uploaded, it gets transcoded via the network. This process generates information for playing the video. Livepeer Studio then stores assets for playback on the Cloud. Alternatively, for the time being, assets can be stored exporting to IPFS (this will be changed in future versions). Information on the uploaded `asset`, e.g. `playbackUrl`, can be retrieved for viewing via a video player or downloaded using the `downloadUrl`.

## Asset Resources

When adding a video file, an asynchronous process, requires processing the file with resources for this process as follows:

### Listing `assets`

Once an asset is uploaded `/request-upload`, the response will return the `id` of that asset.

### Upload `assets`

Adding a video file is an asynchronous process requiring processing the file with the following resources:
- Upload- includes upload via URL and locally, seeing status of assets, listing assets

### Listing `assets` 

### Listing Tasks

### Updating an `asset`

### Deleting an `asset` 

### Storing an `asset` 

All `assets` are stored and played back on Google Cloud, or alternatively, they may be extorted and stored on IPFS.

## On Demand API

You can send video files to Livepeer and get them ready for optimized playback via the [API](/references/vod/). 

You or your users can provide videos (static content), given your application offers an interface for this.

### Caveats

It is important to **note** that:

- Files are limited to 1GB in size and are likely to error out during the upload or processing if they are greater than that.

- Only `MP4` files encoded with `H.264` and `AAC` are supported.
