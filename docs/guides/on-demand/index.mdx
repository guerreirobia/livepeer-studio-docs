## About On Demand 

When an asset is uploaded, it gets transcoded in the Livepeer Network which also generates information for playing the video. Livepeer Studio then stores assets for play back on Google Cloud. Optionally, assets can be stored on IPFS. Information on the uploaded `asset`, e.g. `playbackUrl`, can be retrieved for viewing via a video player or downloaded with the `downloadUrl`.

Adding a video file is an asynchronous process requiring processing the file with the following resources:

- Upload- includes upload via URL and locally, seeing status of assets, listing assets
- Listing Assets - 
- Tasks - includes listing tasks
- Update and Delete
- Storage - store on the google cloud or IPFS for playback

-- top line document with an introduction + "What you need to know" section + caveats, needs to include an explanation of tasks 

(this does not seem to be present in current documentation)


Upload - includes upload via URL and locally, seeing status of assets, listing assets
Tasks -- includes listing tasks
Update and Delete -- Includes update and delete sections
Storage -- export an asset to IPFS include storage works all assets are stored and played back on Google Cloud, but can optionally be stored on IPFS



### Caveats

It is important to **note** that:

- Files are currently limited to 1GB in size. Any files greater than that will likely error out during the upload or processing steps.

- Only `MP4` files encoded with `H.264` and `AAC` are supported.



## Asset Resources

When adding a video file, this is an asynchronous process that requires processing the file. Here are resources for this process:

## Listing the assets

Once an asset is uploaded `/request-upload`, the response will return the `id` of that asset.

## About the On Demand API

The [On Demand API] allows you to send video files to Livepeer and get them ready for optimized playback.

Those videos can be provided either by you (static content) or your users, given your application offers an interface for them to do so.
