## About Livestreaming with Livepeer Studio

Livestreaming is simple with Livepeer Studio. After getting your [API Key](../../guides/livestreaming/api-key), you can create livestreams and make calls to the API to get additional information on that stream. This can be done either through the dashboard or interact directly with the API.

Once a stream is created, you will receive information for that stream such as `Stream ID` for accessing this specific stream, `Stream Key` and  `RTMP URL` for directing the stream into Livepeer Studio from broadcasting software such as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), and `Playback URL` to use in a video player for viewing such as [Video.js](https://videojs.com/).

Below is more information on the capabilities the livestreaming Livepeer Studio has to offer.
