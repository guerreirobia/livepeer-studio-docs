## About Uploading with Livepeer Studio

Uploading is simple with Livepeer Studio. After getting your [API Key](../../guides/livestreaming/api-key), you can upload assets and get additional information on them.

When an asset is uploaded, it gets transcoded in the Livepeer Network, which will generate information for playing the video along with Livepeer Studio storing them for you. Afterward, you can retrieve information on the asset such as the `playbackUrl` to view by using a video player or download it with the provided `downloadUrl`.
