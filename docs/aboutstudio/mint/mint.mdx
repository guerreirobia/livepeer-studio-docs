## About Minting with Livepeer Studio

Livepeer Studio makes minting video NFTs very accessible. After getting your [API Key](../../guides/livestreaming/api-key), you can upload assets to mint them to create a video NFT.

When minting a video NFT, Livepeer Studio provides a `video-nft` script to use which includes a pre-deployed ERC-721 on Polygon `mainnet` and Mumbai `testnet`. Installing this script on your computer prompts you to provide some information such as your API key, the video file in `.mp4` you want to use as the NFT, and the name you want to give to the NFT.

After completing the required information, your file will be transcoded by the Livepeer Network and then exported to IPFS. From here you are provided with `metadata` about your asset including the `nftmMetadataUrl` needed for minting. There will be a `URL` provided to mint either on Polygon `mainnet` or Mumbai `testnet`.



For information on creating your custom ERC-721 contract or to develop your NFT minting project, visit the [Minting guide](../../guides/mint-guides).
