| Term                                | Definition                                                   |

| ABR                                 | An Internet Video Streaming industry standard term, ABR streaming is known as "Adaptive Bitrate Streaming". The Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) ladder can be considered metaphorically and refers to "the array of segments of different quality and resolution which are available from the streaming server. If the bitrate rises, the logic in a video player can select a larger size file with better quality to play, thus resembling the "climbing up of the ladder". |
| API                                 | Refers to the Livepeer Studio API ("the API")                |
| Asset (`asset`)                     | Asset refers to any stored video file accessible via Livepeer. This includes “upload assets” and “recording assets”, that refer to the source of the asset. “Recordings” is not current terminology — just “assets”, or more specifically “recording assets” |
| Audio                               | Livepeer Studio has the capability for playing back audio separately from video (with the proper format for transcoding). For example, if you want to playback Audio only streams, once you upload a video with audio, you can turn the video off. See [Audio Only Streams](http://localhost:3000/guides/livestreaming/playback#audio-only-streams). |
| CDN                                 | [Stream deliver via CDN](http://localhost:3000/core-concepts/cdn) |
| Container                           | A package/wrapper for the media essence, a file format. When files are uploaded they are uploaded with audio and vidio in a "Container" or "Manifest" |
| **DMS**                             | This refers to the Decentralized Media Server built on Web3 principles (in contrast to Web2 centralized media servers) |
| Mint(ing)                           | Creating/converting an additional digital asset (e.g., a .pdft, jpeg, gif, mp3, mp4) and storing it onto the blockchain to take ownership of your digital NFTs. See also NFT |
| NFT                                 | Non Fungible Tokens vs FT "Fungible Token" (i.e. LPT -- Livepeer Token) |
| Progressive File Delivery Protocols | See in our reference section for more information ***See\*** [File Delivery Protocols](http://localhost:3000/references/protocols). |
| Transcoding                         | Transcoding is the process of taking an input source video in one format andbitrate, and converting it to many output rendition videos with different formats and bitrates such that the video can be played on the majority of the devices in the world at any internet connection speed. Additional details on transcoding can be found in [this blog post](https://livepeer.studio/blog/intro-to-transcoding). |
| Webhook                             | ***See\*** our guide on [Webhooks](http://localhost:3000/guides/livestreaming/webhook). |
| WebRTC                              | Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) is a set of browser APIs compatible with secure RTP (SRTP).<br /><br /> WebRTC has all the properties of RTSP with the added bonus of browser compatibility, yet t is still relatively new and not commonly used as of yet but is considered to become the most prevalent protocol in the near future. |
